# Intro

I decided to document my learning journey in different areas of tech. Sharing this repository will give you insights to learning goals that working towards. It will also let you see what things I've completed and review my learning notes.

# Outline

My priortised learning areas are shown in the section `Learning Priorities`. `Detailed Learing Goals` containes goals I have created to improve my skills in `prioritised learning areas`. Files within `/learning_notes` document my learning as I progress through my plan. `backlog.md` is used to capture questions and ideas as they immerge for review and consideration at a later stage.
