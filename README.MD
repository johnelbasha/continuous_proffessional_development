# Intro

I decided to document my learning journey in different areas of tech. Sharing this repository will give you insights to learning goals that working towards. It will also let you see what things I've completed and review my learning notes.

# Outline

My learning areas are shown in the section `Prioritised Learning Areas`. `Detailed Learing Goals` contains goals I am currently working towards. Files within `/learning_notes` document my learning as I progress through my plan. `backlog.md` is used to capture questions and ideas as they immerge for review and consideration at a later stage.
